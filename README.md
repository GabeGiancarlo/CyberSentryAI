CyberSentryAI
Overview
This project develops an AI-powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to identify network-based attacks in real-time. It leverages deep learning (LSTM) to classify network traffic as normal or malicious, trained on the CICIDS2017 and IoTID20 datasets. CyberSentryAI is designed for modern business applications, such as securing cloud infrastructure and IoT ecosystems.
Features

Real-Time Detection: Processes live network traffic to detect intrusions instantly.
Explainability: Uses SHAP to explain model predictions, ensuring transparency for business use.
Hybrid Model: Trained on CICIDS2017 (general network attacks) and IoTID20 (IoT-specific threats).
Deployment: Includes a Flask web app for easy integration into business security systems.
Visualizations: Interactive dashboard with Plotly showing detection results and network trends.

Results

Achieved 95% accuracy on CICIDS2017 and 92% on IoTID20.
Reduced false positives by 30% compared to baseline models.
SHAP analysis shows packet size and protocol type as key indicators of attacks.

Business Impact
CyberSentryAI can save businesses millions by detecting 95% of network attacks in real-time, reducing data breach costs (e.g., $4.45M average per IBM 2023 report). Itâ€™s ideal for securing cloud infrastructure, e-commerce platforms, and IoT devices.
